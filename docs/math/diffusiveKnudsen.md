# Diffusive Knudsen number

The diffusive Knudsen number is defined as the ratio of the collision persistence, scaling with $\left(kTm_{ij}\right)^{1/2}/f_{ij}$ distance to the collision length scale. The diffusive Knudsen number was referred to as the "dimensionless system temperature" in the past.

$$
\mathrm{Kn}_{\mathrm{D}} = \frac{\left(kTm_{ij}\right)^{1/2}}{f_{ij} (a_{i} + a_{j})}
$$

- $k$ is Boltzmann's constant
- $T$ is the temperature
- $m_{ij}$ is the [reduced](reducedQuantity) mass
- $f_{ij}$ is the [reduced](reducedQuantity) [friction factor](frictionFactor)
- $a_{i}$ is the radius of particle $i$
