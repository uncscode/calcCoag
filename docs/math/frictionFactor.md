# Friction factor

Property of the particle's size and surrounding medium. Multiplying the friction factor by the fluid velocity yields the drag force on the particle. It is best thought of as an inverse of mobility or the ratio between thermal energy and the diffusion coefficient.

The modified Stoke's diffusion coefficient is defined as

$$
D_{i} = C_{\mathrm{c}} \frac{kT} {6 \pi  \mu a_{i}}
$$

$$
f_{i} = \frac{kT}{D_{i}} = \frac{6 \pi  \mu a_{i}}{C_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

In the continuum limit ($\mathrm{Kn} \to 0$; $C_{\mathrm{c}} \to 1$):

$$
f_{i} \to 6 \pi  \mu a_{i}
$$

In the kinetic limit ($\mathrm{Kn} \to \infty$):
$$
f_{i} = 8.39 \left(\mu/\lambda\right) a_{i}^{2} \times 1.36
$$
